Responsive Clothes Store (AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript, PHP)

Description is still WIP

Database included
Tried using AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript and PHP for a bunch of different things, just wanted to actually use all of them in one go and I think it turned out pretty well.
Still going to fix it up a bit more, after im done with my other projects, but for now it's fine.
